## Description

The page is structured as a single page with internal links that take the user to each section.
There is a navigation bar that moves around as the user navigates the page. The links on the navigation bar are internal links, that will 'open' their content in the same window. In the Contact Me section, there are three external links which are represnted as the icons of social media websites. These three links will open their content in a new window. 

There are two tables. The first is in the Github section, where there is a CSS-styled table of projects, their current status and tools used. In the Contact Me section, the social media icon links are also organized using tables. 

I used jQuery to animate(requires mouse) the navigation links. They should become bigger on mouse hover. Also there if you click the first photo (gradPhoto) the photo will disappear and the button below toggles the photo as well. I also created a simple gallery at the bottom of the site using jQuery that is interactive. On clicking it will zoom in and you can cycle through the photos. I use some simple media queries to make the navbar slightly bigger on mobile devices and made some fonts slightly bigger.
